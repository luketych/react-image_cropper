# Adding Saved Images Gallery - 2024/03/29 13:58:22

## Intent
- Create a gallery of saved cropped images
- Allow re-cropping of saved images
- Maintain proper timestamp tracking

## Code Changes
- Created new SavedImages component with grid layout
- Added proper timestamp handling in server response
- Updated ImageCropper onSave callback to include timestamps
- Modified App component to manage saved images state
- Implemented image re-selection for further cropping
- Added proper error handling in server endpoints

## Known Issues/Considerations
- Images are stored locally in public/cropped-images
- Session state is not persisted (saved images reset on refresh)
- All saved images need corresponding timestamps for proper display
- Server needs proper directory existence checks for cropped-images folder
