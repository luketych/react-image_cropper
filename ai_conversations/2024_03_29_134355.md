# Image Chopper Refactoring Completion - 2024/03/29 13:43:55

## Intent
- Complete the refactoring of the image cropping component to use react-image-crop
- Ensure proper image scaling and format support
- Maintain file saving functionality while improving the overall implementation

## Code Changes
- Added proper image scaling using naturalWidth/naturalHeight for accurate cropping
- Implemented support for both PNG and JPEG formats with appropriate quality settings
- Added flexible container layout with improved responsive styling
- Enhanced the cropping process with proper aspect ratio support
- Maintained server-side file saving functionality with proper error handling

## Known Issues/Considerations
- The server expects a '/public/cropped-images/' directory to exist for saving files
- CORS must be properly configured when using the component across different domains
- Image quality settings are preset (0.95 for JPEG, 1.0 for PNG)
- Server port is hardcoded to 3001 in both client and server components
