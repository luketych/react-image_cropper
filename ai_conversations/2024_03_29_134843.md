# Image Chopper Aspect Ratio Enhancement - 2024/03/29 13:48:43

## Intent
- Add support for different aspect ratios in the image cropping component
- Provide an intuitive UI for switching between aspect ratios
- Maintain existing functionality while adding new features

## Code Changes
- Added COMMON_ASPECT_RATIOS constant with preset ratios (16:9, 4:3, 3:2, etc.)
- Implemented aspect ratio switching UI with styled buttons
- Added state management for current aspect ratio
- Enhanced crop reset logic when changing aspect ratios
- Maintained proper image scaling and format support

## Known Issues/Considerations
- Aspect ratio changes trigger a crop area reset
- Current aspect ratio is not persisted between sessions
- Custom aspect ratios can be added through the aspectRatios prop
- Mobile responsiveness for aspect ratio buttons relies on flex-wrap
