# Fixed Filename Consistency - 2024/03/29 14:18:52

## Intent
- Fix mismatch between client and server file handling
- Ensure consistent filename usage throughout the system

## Code Changes
- Server generates filenames and returns them in response
- Client uses server-provided filenames for display
- Updated SavedImage interface to use filename instead of timestamp
- Simplified file naming to use .jpg consistently
- App component updated to handle new filename-based system

## Known Issues/Considerations
- All images are saved as JPEG format
- Filenames shown directly in gallery instead of formatted dates
- Files are uniquely named using timestamps in the server
- Client uses filenames from server response for consistency

## To Test
1. Restart the server
2. Load the app
3. Crop and save an image
4. Check that:
   - Image saves successfully
   - Gallery shows correct filename
   - Image loads when clicked
   - No 404 errors in console
