# Server Path Configuration Fix - 2024/03/29 14:05:29

## Intent
- Fix 404 errors by properly configuring server paths
- Set up correct directory structure for static file serving
- Add request logging for better debugging

## Code Changes
- Updated static file serving to use absolute paths
- Added automatic directory creation for all required folders
- Configured proper path resolution for ES modules
- Added request logging middleware
- Improved error handling with console logging

## Server Directory Structure
```
/public
  /cropped-images    # For storing processed images
  /example_images    # For storing example/default images
```

## Known Issues/Considerations
- Server needs to be restarted to apply changes
- All paths are now resolved relative to the server's __dirname
- Added logging to help debug path resolution issues
- Make sure the Node.js process has write permissions for the public directory

## To Test
1. Stop any running server instance
2. Run `node server.ts`
3. Check the console for directory paths
4. Verify the directories exist and have proper permissions
5. Test image uploading and retrieving
