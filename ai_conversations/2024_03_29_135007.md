# Adding Example Images Directory - 2024/03/29 13:50:07

## Intent
- Create a dedicated directory for example images
- Make example images easily accessible via HTTP

## Code Changes
- Created public/example_images directory for storing example images
- Example images will be served at http://localhost:3001/example_images/[filename]
- No server changes needed as express.static('public') already handles serving these files

## Known Issues/Considerations
- Need to add sample images to the example_images directory
- Make sure to use proper image formats (JPG/PNG)
- Images in example_images directory should be read-only
- Consider adding image size restrictions if needed in the future
