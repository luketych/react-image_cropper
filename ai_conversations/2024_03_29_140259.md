# Directory Structure Fixes - 2024/03/29 14:02:59

## Intent
- Fix 404 errors by ensuring proper directory structure
- Add default example image for initial load

## Code Changes
- Added fs checks to create cropped-images directory if it doesn't exist
- Updated server configuration to use absolute path for cropped images
- Added default.jpg to example_images directory
- Ensured proper directory permissions and access

## Known Issues/Considerations
- The server needs to be restarted after making these changes
- The cropped-images directory is created at server startup
- Image storage paths are relative to the server root directory
