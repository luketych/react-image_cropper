# Fixed Timestamp Mismatch - 2024/03/29 14:15:48

## Intent
- Fix mismatch between saved file timestamp and server response timestamp
- Ensure consistent file access after saving

## Code Changes
- Server now extracts timestamp from actual saved filename
- Returns same timestamp used in the filename
- Converts dashes back to colons for ISO format
- Maintains consistency between file path and timestamp

## Known Issues/Considerations
- Timestamps in filename use dashes instead of colons (file system safe)
- Server converts timestamps back to ISO format for the response
- All files are now consistently saved as .jpg
- Make sure to restart server to apply changes
