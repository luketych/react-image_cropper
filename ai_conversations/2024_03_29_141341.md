# Image Cropping Type and Format Fix - 2024/03/29 14:13:41

## Intent
- Fix TypeScript errors with crop units
- Ensure proper initial crop creation
- Make image format handling consistent

## Code Changes
- Added proper TypeScript unit types for crops
- Fixed initial crop area creation and conversion
- Switched all saves to JPEG format for consistency
- Added proper conversion between percent and pixel crops
- Improved image load state handling

## Known Issues/Considerations
- All images are now saved as JPEG regardless of input format
- Initial crop is created automatically on image load
- Need to restart the server to apply changes
- Check browser console for detailed logging

## To Test
1. Restart the server
2. Load the app
3. Initial crop should be automatically created
4. SAVE CROPPED IMAGE button should be enabled
5. Saved images should appear in gallery
