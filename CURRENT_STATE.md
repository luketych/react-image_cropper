# Current State of the Application

## Overview
This is a web application that provides functionality for cropping both images and audio files. The application is built using React with TypeScript and uses a Node.js/Express backend for file handling.

## Technical Stack
- Frontend:
  - React 18
  - TypeScript
  - Material-UI (MUI)
  - WaveSurfer.js for audio visualization
  - Vite as the build tool
- Backend:
  - Node.js with Express
  - Multer for file uploads
  - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

## Features

### Audio Cropping
- Waveform visualization using WaveSurfer.js
- Play/pause functionality
- Start and end time selection using range inputs
- Time display in minutes:seconds format
- Audio cropping with WAV format output
- File upload to server
- Saved audio files management

### Image Cropping
- Image upload and display
- Cropping interface
- Saved images management

### File Management
- Automatic directory creation for different file types
- Unique filename generation with timestamps
- Static file serving
- File upload handling with proper error management

## Current Limitations
1. Audio cropping only supports WAV format output
2. No progress indication during file uploads
3. No file size limits or validation
4. No error handling UI for failed operations
5. No file type validation on the frontend
6. No preview of cropped audio before saving

## Development Setup
1. Frontend runs on Vite's development server
2. Backend runs on port 3001
3. Static files are served from the public directory
4. CORS is enabled for local development

## Next Steps
1. Add MP3 format support for audio cropping
2. Implement file size limits and validation
3. Add proper error handling and user feedback
4. Add audio preview functionality
5. Implement file type validation
6. Add loading states and progress indicators
7. Improve the UI/UX of the cropping interface
