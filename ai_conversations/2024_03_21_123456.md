# Image Chopper Component Library Implementation

## Intent
A) Create a React component library for image viewing and cropping that can be imported into other React projects
B) Implement two main components:
   - ImageViewer: For viewing images with zoom and pan capabilities
   - ImageCropper: For cropping images with a draggable selection area
C) Ensure compatibility with the main project's requirements and dependencies

## Implementation
A) Project Setup:
   - Created Vite project with React and TypeScript
   - Configured package.json with required dependencies
   - Set up Vite configuration for library build
   - Added Material-UI integration

B) Components:
   - ImageViewer:
     - Zoom in/out functionality
     - Pan/drag support
     - Responsive container sizing
   - ImageCropper:
     - Draggable crop area
     - Canvas-based image cropping
     - Base64 output format

C) Documentation:
   - Added comprehensive README
   - Included usage examples
   - Documented props and callbacks

## Known Issues/Uncertainties
1. Performance optimization may be needed for large images
2. Consider adding aspect ratio constraints for cropping
3. May need to add support for more image formats
4. Consider adding image rotation capabilities
5. May need to add error handling for failed image loads
