# Image Chopper Refactoring - 2024/03/29 13:26:52

## Intent
- Refactor the image cropping component to use react-image-crop library
- Make the component more reusable and importable into other React applications
- Simplify the implementation while maintaining core functionality

## Code Changes
- Replace custom cropping implementation with react-image-crop
- Remove unnecessary Material-UI dependencies
- Implement proper TypeScript types for better type safety
- Add proper export configuration for package usage

## Known Issues/Considerations
- Need to ensure proper handling of both PNG and JPG formats
- Image quality settings might need adjustment based on usage
- Base64 output might need to be configurable for different use cases
