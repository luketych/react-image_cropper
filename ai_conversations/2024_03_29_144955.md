# Audio Cropping Implementation Fix - 2024/03/29 14:49:55

## Intent
- Fix TypeScript errors in AudioCropper component
- Properly handle Web Audio API buffer manipulation
- Enable type-safe access to WaveSurfer internals

## Code Changes
- Added TypeScript declarations for WaveSurfer
- Updated tsconfig.json to include custom type definitions
- Improved audio buffer handling and WAV file creation
- Fixed file type detection and processing

## Technical Details
1. Audio Processing Flow:
   - Get AudioBuffer from WaveSurfer backend
   - Calculate start/end samples based on time selection
   - Create new AudioBuffer for cropped section
   - Render to WAV format with proper headers
   - Upload to server as WAV file

## Known Issues/Considerations
- Requires Web Audio API support
- Audio buffer operations are memory-intensive
- WAV format used for maximum compatibility
- Buffer operations happen synchronously

## To Test
1. Load an MP3 file
2. Select start and end times
3. Click SAVE CROPPED AUDIO
4. Verify WAV file is created
5. Check playback of saved file
