# Added Audio File Support - 2024/03/29 14:43:20

## Intent
- Add support for audio file cropping
- Create necessary directories and default files
- Update server to handle both image and audio files

## Code Changes
- Added AudioCropper component with waveform visualization
- Added SavedAudios component for audio gallery
- Created tabbed interface in App component
- Updated server to handle audio file uploads
- Created script to generate default audio sample
- Added proper file type detection and handling

## Directory Structure
```
/public
  /cropped-images/   # For cropped image files
  /cropped-audio/    # For cropped audio files
  /example_images/   # For default/example images
  /example_audio/    # For default/example audio files
```

## Known Issues/Considerations
- Requires ffmpeg for audio file generation
- Audio files are saved as MP3 format
- Uses Web Audio API for audio processing
- Uses wavesurfer.js for waveform visualization

## To Test
1. Run `node scripts/generate-audio.js` to create default audio
2. Restart server
3. Test both image and audio tabs
4. Verify cropping and saving works for both types
5. Check file playback in galleries
